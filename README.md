# AlgorithmsProject
The development of an algorithms project at university. The project is focused on the edit_distance algorithm and figuring out the minimum distance between letters of words. The project also includes file handling and memory allocation to allow the user to fix misspelled words. There are two parts to this project. The first part is developing an edit distance table based on the words given by the user. In the second part of the project, the user is given the option to use the files and is given a menu of words to pick from to fix the word or leave it as it is. Alternatively, the user can fix the word instead by typing the new word. 

How to run:
1. gcc -g spell_checker.c spell.c
2. ./a.out
